# 100 d3 visualizations in 100 days

To get a better grasp of the [d3.js](http://www.d3js.org/) visualization library, I've decided to make 100 toy example visualizations over the course of 100 days.

Suggestions or comments? Email me at `nirum@stanford.edu`

The HTML for each visualization is in the `partials/` folder, and the corresponding javascript is in `js/controllers.js` (I used Angular to host the pages).

I'll be adding one visualization a day. The full list is here:
- August 25, 2013: Linear Regression
- August 26, 2013: Moving Dots
