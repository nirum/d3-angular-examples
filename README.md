# 100 d3 visualizations in 100 days

To get a better grasp of the [d3.js](http://www.d3js.org/) visualization library, I've decided to make 100 toy example visualizations over the course of 100 days.

Suggestions or comments? Email me at `nirum@stanford.edu`

I'll be adding one a day. The full list is here:
