# d3-angular examples

Some toy visualizations made with [d3.js](http://www.d3js.org/) and [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/).

Suggestions or comments? Email me at `nirum@stanford.edu`

The HTML for each visualization is in the `partials/` folder, and the corresponding javascript is in `js/controllers.js`
